*Data referenced from the [palmerpenguins library](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) in R by Allison Horst.*

### Overview

Size measurements, clutch observations, and blood isotope ratios for 344 adult foraging Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica. Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research (LTER)](https://pal.lternet.edu/)  Program.


The deployed web app is live at [here](https://share.streamlit.io/timmyy3000/penguins-clf-heroku/main/penguin-app.py)

The purpose of this ML Web App is to make a dynamic prediction of the species of a penguin based on its characteristics:

* Island
* Bill length
* Bill depth
* Flipper length
* Body mass
* Sex

## Tools

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* pickle
